# Java Multiplayer Battleship

This repository contains my solution for the midterm project of the Advanced-Programming-Spring2020 course at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.
As I developed this in my early years of programming, it may have some minor bugs or inefficiencies.

It is a simple Battleship game which contains a server connected to the clients using sockets. The client's GUI is made using JavaFX.
